# Majority Element

    #

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print('Unit 2 Assignment 2: Majority Element')

    # 1) How does the recursion terminate
    # 2) How is the case where N is odd Handled?
    # 3) What is the runtime complexity of the algorithm in terms of Big-Oh? 
    # 4) how can we avoid using an extra array, B
    # 5) write a program to compute the majority element and test it accordingly
