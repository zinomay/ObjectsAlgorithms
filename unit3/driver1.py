if __name__=="__main__":
    # sort an array of 5000 randomly generated integers using each of the algorithms and compute runtime
    # Run each sort on the array at least 5 different times. Ensure teh same array is sorted for consistency

    # Heap sort

    # insertion sort

    # merge sort

    # quick sort
