# Unit 3 Assignment 1
# Heap Insertion Analysis

# Program must use array-based version of the min-heap implementation

# a. Insert them into a heap one by one (percolate up)
# b. build a heap in linear time (percolate down)

if __name__=="__main__":
    # Using two different approaches to build a heap
    # insert integers 1 to 5000 into a heap in the following orders:
    # Integers
    myInts = [2, 45, 12, 1, 56, 78, 13, 14, 5, 8, 9, 3, 11, 34]
    # 1. Sorted

    # 2. Reverse-sorted
    # 3. Random
